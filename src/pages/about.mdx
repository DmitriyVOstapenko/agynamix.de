Hi, my name is Torsten. 

I'm a full stack software developer with more than 20 years of experience in numerous fields and with numerous languages.

I live in Germany, married with 2 kids.

I love learning new things and meeting new people.

Over the years I have worked with a plethora of different languages.
I worked with Cobol, C++, Java, Groovy, Ruby and Perl.
Since 2009 I have transitioned into using Scala, Javascript, Clojure and Typescript, with a sprinkle of GO.

I worked with numerous web frameworks including Lift, AngularJS, MarkoJS and my favorite, ReactJS.

I developed and sold several applications, some of them are available now on my github account.

Over the years I have worked with a [large number of clients](/clients).

      style={{maxHeight: 250, display: 'block', marginBottom: 4, borderRadius: '5px'}}
      src={bread}
    />
  </div>
  <div>
    To relax and regenerate I love baking my own sourdough bread.

I would love hearing from you and working with you.

Torsten.
