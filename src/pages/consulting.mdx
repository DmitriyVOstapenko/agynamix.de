I'm a full stack software developer with more than 20 years of experience in numerous fields and with numerous languages.

I have developed software for all of my professional life and even [before](/about), and I didn't really want to do anything else.
Languages change, developer roles change, but the desire to create something useful always stays strong.

I love learning new things and meeting new people. 
Over the years I have worked with a plethora of different programming languages.
I worked with Cobol, C++, Java, Groovy, Ruby and Perl.

Since 2009 I have transitioned into using Scala, Javascript, Clojure and Typescript, with a sprinkle of GO.

I worked with numerous web frameworks including Lift, AngularJS, MarkoJS and my favorite, ReactJS.

I use to keep my application's data in SQL databases like PostgreSQL and NoSQL stores, mostly MongoDB.

I developed and sold several applications, some of them are available now on my [github account](https://github.com/tuhlmann).

Over the years I have worked with a large number of [clients](/clients), including:

- German Telekom
- the german bank 1822 Sparkasse
- the social network sgrouples, now mewe.com
- Underscore Consulting
- Ascendant, Inc.
