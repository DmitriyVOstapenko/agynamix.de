## Summary 
My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I'm a german software developer with a passion to create 
great and useful software.

I'm an experienced Java consultant with more than 20 years experience and successful 
projects in C++, Java, Ruby, Groovy, Scala and GO. My main focus is on enterprise 
software development and full stack web application development with technologies 
like Scala and Lift, Clojure or Typescript.

I authored the Lift Web Applications How-to: http://www.packtpub.com/lift-web-applications/book  
On my Github page you'll find numerous projects I've worked on over the last 
decade: https://github.com/tuhlmann

I enjoy meeting new people and facing new challenges.
I'm particularly good at integrating into teams and getting myself involved in the subject.
If you are looking for an accomplished software developer I'd love hearing from you.

Technologies have changed over time. One thing that steadily remained is my curiosity for new languages and methodologies.
I particularly enjoyed transitioning from being an imperative programmer with C++ and Java into using a more functional approach with Scala, Clojure and Typescript.

Current technologies:  
- DB: PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- languages: Scala, Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript, Typescript  
- web frameworks: Liftweb, AngularJS, MarkoJS, ReactJS

## Training & Publications

#### Java Trainer
> ML Consulting, Sep 2011 → Dec 2011 (4 months)

I was teaching several Java and programming basics courses at ML Consulting Dresden and Berlin. 
I got very good ratings from my students and the manager of the consulting facility wants me back for more.

#### Speaking about Scala and Lift3
> Scala Days 2013 New York, Scala Exchange 2013, London

I was giving talks at Scala conferences about my [Lift](https://liftweb.net), the Scala web framework I'm involved with for many years.

#### Author of 'Lift Web Applications HowTo'

Together with Pack Publishing I authored a small book about Lift, 
the ['Lift Web Applications HowTo'](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/instant-lift-web-applications-how-instant).

## My Story

#### Software Developer Consultant
> Ascendant Compliance Management, Jul 2013 → Feb 2019 (5 years, 8 months)

> Tech: angularjs, scala, lift, mongodb, javascript

In a small team of awesomely great developers we implement a suite of tools 
using best of breed frameworks like AngularJS for the frontend. 
The backend server is developed as a set of Scala applications on top 
of the Lift web framework. We use the MongoDB database.

#### Scala & Lift Consultant
> Twisp Inc, Mar 2013 → Jul 2013 (5 months)

> Tech: scala, lift, mysql, squeryl

For a client I'm developing a Lift based information engine application.

#### Scala & Lift Developer @ Underscore Consulting
> Underscore Consulting, Nov 2012 → Apr 2013 (6 months)

> Tech: scala, lift, mongodb, cloudbees

I was in charge of developing part of a Scala/Lift client application 
together with a really cool team of Underscore developers.

#### Scala & Lift Senior Consultant
> Sgrouples.com, Sep 2011 → Sep 2012 (1 year, 1 month)

> Tech: Scala, Lift, Mongodb, Amazon EC2

With a small bunch of other high profile developers we develop the social groups 
platform https://sgrouples.com (now: https://mewe.com).

We develop this site using Scala, Lift and MongoDB.

#### Designer and Developer
> AGYNAMIX, Oct 2008 → 2011

> Tech: Java, SWT, JFace, Install4j

I developed a small cross platform application that is used to copy your computers 
clipboard contents, files or whole directories to connected machines.

Simidude is a cross platform network clipboard and file sharing tool.
When it starts up it automatically checks your local lan for other running instances 
and connects to them. After that transmitting a file from one machine to another is 
just a drag and drop operation with Simidude.

Simidude runs on Windows, Linux and Mac computers, as well as in virtual machines.

#### Project Manager, Developer, Marketer
> AGYNAMIX, 2005 → 2015

> Tech: Java, Eclipse RCP, Groovy, Grails, Jsf, J2ee

I started AGYNAMIX by the end of 2004 to create a company where I could create great 
software according to what I have learned in the past decade and not according to managers 
that have never delivered a line of code.

My first product was a monitoring software for water supply companies. 
It was a pretty large project featuring a server side Java application written 
using these technologies:

the Spring framework
a PostgreSql database
Java COM connectivity to manage GSM modems to send warnings
an OPC (Ole for Process Control) COM library to connect to existing software

With these tools I developed an Eclipse RCP application that uses Eclipse GEF to 
visualize the data (show a nice chart and current values).

#### JSF Developer
> 1822direct Sparkasse, 2009 → 2009

> Tech: Java, JBoss, Tomcat, JSF

Development of a JSF (Java Server Faces) front end for an in house application to manage correspondence to their customers. 
We used Tomcat 5, JBoss and JSF 1.2 with MyFaces for development and deployment.

#### Software Developer
> T-Systems SL SI, 2005 - 2011

As a contractor for T-Systems I was involved in numerous projects:

__I maintained__ a mid sized Eclipse RCP application that is used in-house in the test department. 
The application is developed using these technologies: Eclipse RCP EMF: Eclipse Modeling Framework Teneo: 
Database persistence using Hibernate and Oracle for EMF models JDBC: 
lower level JDBC programming for a number of features that need direct db access

__I extended__ an already existing migration framework (which I helped develop some years ago) 
which is designed for the transformation of mass data.

One part of the assignment is to extend the core functionality of the framework to fit the current requirements.

One of my other tasks was the creation of an Eclipse RCP application for the existing DSL (Domain Specific Language). 
Eclipse Plugins had been written using the XText framework to lift the weight of writing XML files from the authors of the business rules. 
They now get an updatable RCP application delivered to their machines which they use to write business rules in a domain specific 
and environmentally clean language. The application will then generate the XML for them.

__Create__ and extend a Perl based test framework. A complex framework allows quick creation of new test scenarios that will be executed 
in a distributed manner on Unix machines. I also extended a number of test tools that were developed as Eclipse RCP applications 
using the Eclipse EMF framework.

__Design__ and development of a high performance data extraction application.
The application would read data from multiple Oracle schemas, aggregates it and distributes it into multiple files and other databases.
The application needs to process millions of records in just a few hours. 
This level of performance was only possible with careful design and multi threading.

__We developed__ a fairly complex application that would generate invoices using LaTeX and send them - optionally 
signed and encrypted - by email to the customer. The application was designed to run in multiple processes, 
possibly distributed across multiple machines. The distributed C++ components used Corba to communicate. 
Data was stored in a Oracle database. There also was a self service website written Java and servlet (yuck) technology.
